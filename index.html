# Community Building?

???
What does this have to do with community building?

---

# Community Building
- Meet your audience where they live
- Every device
- Every context


???

- Cannot make the same assumptions about attention
- May be multi-tasking, maybe not full screen
- May be distracted
- low bandwidth?

---

# Understand your Media/Technology
- Capabilities
- Limitations
- Biases

???

# For example:
## Web/Interactive
- Capability: Web is networked, real-time updates, connected to other viewers
- Limitations: Network sometimes goes down or is slow

## Film/TV
- Capability: high, predictable resolution
- Limitation: limited devices, not future-proof

---

# Conventions and Patterns
- Orient the audience
- Shorthand
- Show, don't tell

???

Show, don't tell:
- ways to connect emotionally, not just intellectually
- allows us to skip the explanation.
- don't have to say, "okay, this scene is at a different place now"
- also shouldn't have to say, "click here to make stuff happen"
- takes time for users
- presentation vs. representation?

---

# Conventions in traditional film
- Montage
- Establishing shots
- 180 degree rule
- Exegetic vs. diagetic sound

---

# Interactive video needs new conventions
- **Not TV on the web**
- see: early days of film
- see: web graphic design c. 1995

## Q: What is possible?
## A: Everything.
- Web Audio API
- WebGL (GPU)
- Device APIs (orientation, location, etc.)

---

# Questions
- What not to do?
- Creation/Construction process
- How far can we push it?

---

# Thank you
