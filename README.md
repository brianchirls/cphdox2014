Slides from a brief [presentation at CPH:DOX 2014](http://cphdox.dk/en/screening/community-building)

> This seminar takes a look at how you can involve your community already during the development phase, and how new digital technologies make it possible to engage them and interact with them. John Jackson, a professional public affairs strategist for companies such as Purpose and the co-author of 'Small Acts of Resistance' will moderate the panel, which consists of Kerstin Ãœberlacker from Sweden, who will talk about the transmedia project Ghostrocket about UFO data, the Danish artist group Wooloo who will talk about their social and political community experiments, and finally the American creative media developer Brian Chirls will show us what is technologically possible today, as well as how the opportunities create new rules for how we can involve the audience. Co-organized by SWIM.
